Requirements: </br>
Python 3.8.7 </br>

To run this:

1. Enter the **Project** folder in the command shell
2. run "py manage.py createsuperuser" in your terminal (in order to login to the admin page of Django)
3. run "py manage.py runserver" in your terminal (making the website live)
4. go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ for a view of the databases (admin page)

Notes:</br>
Posts only can be made through the admin terminal, so you MUST create an admin login in order to create posts. </br>
Basic editing and deleting work </br>
Fields for editing are automatically filled in (ex. the text saved by the user is autofilled into a field) </br>
